## BFM Consortium Agreement

The development of the BFM is supported by a formal agreement, which establishes a program for model development that is discussed and prepared every year by the participants. Model developments are inserted by the System Team into the different releases of the model. The agreement is open to entrance of more contributors and more information can be requested to BFM-Community System Team.

The Consortium organization is detailed in the BFM agreement and current members of the consortium are: CMCC, OGS, UNIBO, UCT, and SYKE.
